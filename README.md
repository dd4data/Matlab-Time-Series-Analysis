My M.Sc. in Economics Thesis:
"International Connectedness of Economic Variables â€“ Evidence from New Time Series Methods"
See main coding files: "dailystock.m" and "volatility.m". The other files are Matlab functions written by myself.
- My work includes: 
- Utilized daily stock market indices data from eight markets spanning 2006 to 2019.
- Measure international connectedness in financial markets using the out-of-sample forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) approach within a generalized vector autoregression model.
- Conducted a comparative analysis with the in-sample FEVD approach, a common method in the network literature.
